feat: Add simultaneous 3-axis joystick control for improved ergonomics

BREAKING CHANGE: Red button behavior changed - no longer toggles between XY and Z modes

Major improvements:
- Implemented independent Z-axis analog input on GPIO 39
- All three axes (X, Y, Z) now respond simultaneously to joystick input
- Removed mode switching requirement for more intuitive operation
- Added readJSZ() function with hysteresis for smooth Z-axis control
- Updated jog command to support 3D movement: $J=G21G91X%fY%fZ%fF%d

Hardware:
- Added PIN_JSZ (GPIO 39) for Z-axis joystick potentiometer
- Z-axis calibration integrated into startup sequence
- Compatible with existing TTGO T-Display hardware

Software Changes:
- src/Pendant.h: Added PIN_JSZ, calibrateZ variable, display commands
- src/Joystick.h: Implemented readJSZ(), removed XY/Z toggle logic
- src/Setup.h: Added Z-axis calibration (100-sample averaging)
- src/TFT_Draw.h: Updated visual indicators (removed mode-dependent colors)
- src/ButtonHandlers.h: Simplified red button to always use jsXYaxis mode

Benefits:
- No more mode switching - all axes available instantly
- True 3D diagonal jogging capability
- Improved user experience and workflow efficiency
- Maintains backward compatibility with original FluidNC WebSocket protocol

Migration:
- Connect Z-axis potentiometer to GPIO 39
- Red button now serves as XYZ selector instead of mode toggle
- All three axes respond to joystick input simultaneously

Tested on: TTGO T-Display with ESP32
FluidNC WebSocket: v1.0.0 compatible
